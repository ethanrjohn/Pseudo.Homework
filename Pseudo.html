Leonardo da Vinci (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now
Clos-Lucé], France) was an Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence,
perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and
Mona Lisa (c. 1503–19) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His notebooks
reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.
